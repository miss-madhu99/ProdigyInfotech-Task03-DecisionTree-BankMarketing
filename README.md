# 🌳 Task-03: Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Dataset

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship** with **Prodigy Infotech**.  
The objective is to build a **Decision Tree Classifier** that predicts whether a customer will purchase a product or subscribe to a term deposit, based on their demographic and behavioral data.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Preprocess the data (cleaning, encoding, scaling)
- Split dataset into train and test sets
- Train a Decision Tree classifier
- Evaluate model performance
- Visualize the decision tree

---

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Graphviz / dtreeviz (for visualization)

---

## 📂 Dataset Source

**Bank Marketing Dataset – UCI Machine Learning Repository**  
🔗 [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)

## 🔍 Steps Performed

### 🧹 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing or unknown values
- Categorical columns encoded using LabelEncoder/OneHotEncoder
- Features scaled if necessary

### 🧪 2. Train-Test Split
- Dataset split into 80% training and 20% testing

### 🌳 3. Model Training
- Used `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `sklearn.tree`
- Tuned hyperparameters (max_depth, criterion)

### 📊 4. Evaluation
- Evaluated using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, **classification report**
- Visualized the **decision tree**

---

## 📈 Results

- Achieved an accuracy of around **X%** (add your result)
- The decision tree revealed that **contact type**, **previous campaign outcome**, and **job** are strong predictors

## ✅ Status

> **Task Completed Successfully ✔️**  
This project helped me understand real-world classification workflows and decision tree modeling using Scikit-learn.
